Autodiscover.py README

The driver of the autodiscover proces is autodiscover(...).
It folows steps for implenting an autodiscover client found here :

    "Calling Autodiscover"

It implements steps 2-6, BUT NOT 5.
We can skip step 1, its an Active Directory thing.
Step 5 should be implemented when we can test against an exchange account
    whose domain has an srv record look up. This should be easy to do.
    
In autodiscover(...):
    - wrap "Step 3" in a try/except that handles AutodiscoverErrors,
    --- In the except AutodiscoverError, e:
        - Do a DNS SRV-record query for _autodiscover._tcp.domain
        - If there are results, use a random one as the argument to
          autoredirect, witht he path=/autodiscover/autodiscover.xml
